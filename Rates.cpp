/*The bus company has three different type vehicles: (1) luxury bus (2) mini bus, and (3) minivan. 
There are 3 luxury buses, 4 small buses and 4 minivans. The luxury bus has 52 seats (2x11 seats and 3x10 seats), 
the small bus has 36 seats (1x12 and 2x12) and the minivan has 12 seats (3x4).
In  luxury  bus,  the aisle  and  window  seat  costs   $0.95  per  mile,  and the other seat  costs  $0.75 per mile. 
In small bus, both the aisle seat and window seat costs 0.65. In case of the minivan, each seat cost $0.50 per  mile.  
In  case  of  bus  hire,  the  luxury  bus  cost  $1500 as rent with additional $0.25 for each  mile  of travel.  
The  small  bus  costs   $1300  as  rent  with  additional  $0.20  per  mile  whereas  the minivan  costs  $1000  
as  rent  with  additional  $0.15  per  mile.  
The  security  deposit  for  luxury  bus  is  $5000,   for  the  small  bus  $3000  and  for  the  minivan  it  is  $1500  
which  will  be  reimbursed  upon returning the  vehicle.  
The  rows  in  the  buses are alphabetically numbered. 
Thus, the A and C mark the window seats in all kinds of vehicles. 
However, the B and E are the aisle seats in the luxury bus, B and D are the aisle seats marked in the minibus 
whereas in the minivan, there is no aisle seat. The buses haul passengers to and from Green Bay  from/to  the  following  routes.  
The  buses  are  identified  by  unique  identifier  and  have  their  registration details stored including a list of drivers who drive them. 
A single driver can drive multiple buses. 

Source		Destination		Distance
Green Bay	Madison			135.6 miles
Green Bay	Milwaukee		118.7 miles
Green Bay	Whitewater		142.2 miles
Green Bay	Oshkosh			50.4 miles
Green Bay	Eau Claire		194.4 miles
For  each  ticket  and  bus  hire  is  subject  to  government  tax  of  10%  which  can  change  periodically.  
The  company  wants  to  profit  25%  on  all  ticket  sales  and  hire.  Remember  that the  security  deposit  is  not  taxable.  
Passengersâ€™   refunds  are  also  taxable.  
All  sales  need  to  store  permanently in file(s) so that they can retrieve later for administration tasks.*/
