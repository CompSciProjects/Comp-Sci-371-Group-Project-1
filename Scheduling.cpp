/*To  any  destination,  the  company  intends  to  operate  at  least  3  services   a  week  
to  and  from  any  destination. However, depending on the demand, the company can operate extra 
service providing that there is a bus available. 
The demand should meet at least 50% of particular bus type. 
When you schedule  one  bus  for  a  particular  destination,  make  sure  you  have  an  available  
bus  at  that  depot.  You  have  11  buses  and  6  destinations.  Therefore,  depending  on  the  passengersâ€™  reservation,  
there  must be one bus available to complete the travel. 
You may consider keeping an inventory of vehicles located in different depots. */
