/*The inventory of buses is available for hire for recreational purpose. 
Once a customer requests for a bus hire, your responsibility is to check the inventory 
of the buses available from the location on the particular  date  requested.  Remember,  
bus  hire  is  always  profitable  since  you  can  charge  for  the  all  seats  available  in  the  bus.  
So  if  the  number  of  reservations  for  that  bus  is  not  half  full  on  that  particular date, 
it is always better to allow for bus hire. The reserving customer hiring the bus should enter  the  same  
biographical  information  as  for  normal  ticket  reservation.  
All  kinds  of  information  regarding  the   hire   needs   to   store   permanently   in   file(s)   
so   that   they   can   retrieve   later   for   administration tasks.*/
